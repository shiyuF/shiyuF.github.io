Supervised by Dr. Patricio A. Vela","highlights":["Created an egocentric perception space by combining stixel and sparse features estimated from the stereo camera. The perception propagates to maintain temporal information for perception space collision checking (PiPS). It has better computational efficiency and scalability among different workstations and embedded devices.","Designed a Potential Gap local planning that formulates potential fields from sparse gaps to generate safe trajectories. The gaps are detected within any laser scan-like egocentric perception to represent collision free region.","Proposed a trajectory servoing method to track Cartesian trajectories within image space composed of sparse feature points from V-SLAM. It reduces the reliance on the accuracy of pose estimation.","Implemented a hierarchical vision-based planning framework (GPF-BG) integrating our previous Global Path Follower (GPF) navigation system and a gap-based local planner using BÃ©zier curves (BG) for safe quadrupedal navigation.","Extended the Potential Gap navigation technique by guaranteeing safety for nonholonomic robots in all tiers of hierarchy. Nonlinear MPC with a keyhole-shaped zeroing barrier function is applied to track local trajectories and ensure safety.","Trained a deep learning model to synthesize ego-centric collision free trajectories from stereo image inputs. Learning model is utilized as an explainable method for choosing the best trajectory.","Developed multiple hierarchical navigation systems, e.g., GPF-X, for different robotic platforms: mobile robots, mobile manipulation robots, snake-like robots, and quadrupedal robots.","Benchmarked different navigation performance in ROS/Gazebo simulation and real robots with stereo cameras, depth cameras, and laser scanner."]},{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology, ECE","position":"ORS Undergraduate Research Mentor","url":"","startDate":"2019-08","endDate":"Present","summary":"Lead undergraduate research on vision-based navigation including image processing, obstacle avoidance, path planning, control, deep learning and so on."},{"name":"Seres (SF Motors), ADAS Team","position":"Perception Engineer Intern","url":"","startDate":"2018-05","endDate":"2018-08","summary":"Supervised by Chongyu Wang and Fan Wang","highlights":["Implemented C++ OpenCV algorithm to achieve stop-line and traffic light detection using image processing approaches.","Deployed the algorithm on a real testing car in ROS environment, and accomplished field test.","Contributed to deep learning detection model training and image annotation.","Assisted in completing camera installation, calibration, and image acquisition."]},{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology, ME","position":"Teaching Practicum","url":"","startDate":"2021-08","endDate":"2021-12","summary":"ME 3017: System Dynamics.
