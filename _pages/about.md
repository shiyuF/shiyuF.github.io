I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am a member of Intelligent Vision and Automation Laboratory (IVALab) supervised by Dr. Patricio A. Vela. My research focuses on vision-based hierarchical navigation using sparse representation to improve the computational efficiency and scalability. The research involves perception, path planning, controls, collision avoidance, and robot safety. I am an enthusiast in robots' software and hardware. Have a lot of hands-on experience to play with stereo and depth cameras, LiDAR, laser scanner, and multiple mobile robots. Proficient with C++, Python, MATLAB, ROS/Gazebo, and deep learning packages. I received the B.Eng. degree from Chongqing University in 2015, and the M.Eng. degree from University of California at Berkeley in 2016. In my free time, I like hiking and playing video games.
